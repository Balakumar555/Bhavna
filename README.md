📌 Assignment: Dynamic Dashboard (React/Angular + API)
🎯 Goal
Create a dynamic dashboard UI using React or Angular that:
•	Fetches data from a REST API
•	Displays the data in:
o	A table
o	One or more charts (e.g., bar, line, pie)
You can use libraries like:
•	For React: Chart.js, Recharts, React-Table, Material UI
•	For Angular: ngx-charts, Angular Material, ng2-charts

🧾 Guidelines
🔧 1. Tech Stack
•	Choose either React or Angular (your choice)
•	Use TypeScript (preferred but not mandatory)
•	REST API can be mocked or use public APIs (suggestions below)
🌐 2. API Integration
•	Use a public API (like JSONPlaceholder, OpenWeatherMap, or any other)
•	Or, mock your own REST API (using tools like json-server, mockoon, or hardcoded JSON)
•	Fetch and display:
o	At least one dataset in a table
o	At least one chart visualization of relevant data
💡 3. Functionality to Implement
Your dashboard should include:
•	A responsive layout
•	A table displaying data with basic features:
o	Pagination, sorting, or filtering (any one or more)
•	A chart or graph showing insights based on the data
•	Optional (bonus points):
o	Search/filter feature
o	Modular code with reusable components
o	Error handling/loading states
o	UI polish with design framework (Bootstrap, Material, etc.)
📁 4. Project Structure
•	Organize your codebase using standard conventions
•	Add comments where necessary
•	Provide a README.md with:
o	Brief explanation of the project
o	How to run the app locally
o	Any dependencies or setup steps
